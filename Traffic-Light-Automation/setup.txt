**Smart Dustbin Setup Guide**

**Components Required:**
1. Arduino Board (Uno, Mega, etc.)
2. Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
3. Light Sensor (LDR)
4. Four LEDs
5. Jumper Wires
6. Power Source (USB Cable or 9V Battery)

**Wiring Instructions:**
1. **Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04):**
   - VCC to 5V on Arduino
   - GND to GND on Arduino
   - Trig to Digital Pin 2
   - Echo to Digital Pin 3

2. **Light Sensor (LDR) with Resistor:**
   - One leg of LDR to 5V
   - Other leg of LDR to Analog Pin A0 and a 10kΩ resistor to GND

3. **LEDs:**
   - LED1 Anode to Digital Pin 5, Cathode to GND (via a 220Ω resistor)
   - LED2 Anode to Digital Pin 6, Cathode to GND (via a 220Ω resistor)
   - LED3 Anode to Digital Pin 7, Cathode to GND (via a 220Ω resistor)
   - LED4 Anode to Digital Pin 8, Cathode to GND (via a 220Ω resistor)

**Code Upload Instructions:**
1. Connect the Arduino to your PC via USB cable.
2. Open Arduino IDE.
3. Copy and paste the smart dustbin code into the Arduino IDE.
4. Click on **Verify** to check for errors.
5. Click on **Upload** to upload the code to the Arduino board.

**Troubleshooting:**
- If the LEDs are not turning on, check wiring and resistor connections.
- If the ultrasonic sensor is not detecting distance, verify connections and try replacing the sensor.
- If the light sensor is not working, check its wiring and resistor setup.
- Ensure correct COM port is selected in the Arduino IDE.

**Notes:**
- Adjust the `ANALOG_THRESHOLD` value if necessary to optimize the light sensor sensitivity.
- Ensure the LEDs are not overloaded.
- Use an external power supply if multiple components cause insufficient power issues.

**Safety Precautions:**
- Avoid short circuits while connecting wires.
- Do not apply excessive force to components.
- Handle electronic components carefully to prevent static damage.

This guide ensures proper setup of the smart dustbin system for smooth functionality.
