**Smart Dustbin Setup Guide**

**Components Required:**
1. Arduino Board (Uno, Mega, etc.)
2. Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
3. Servo Motor (SG90 or MG995)
4. Jumper Wires
5. Power Source (USB Cable or 9V Battery)

**Wiring Instructions:**
1. **Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04):**
   - VCC to 5V on Arduino
   - GND to GND on Arduino
   - Trig to Digital Pin 5
   - Echo to Digital Pin 6

2. **Servo Motor:**
   - Red (VCC) to 5V on Arduino
   - Black (GND) to GND on Arduino
   - Signal (Yellow/Orange) to Digital Pin 7

**Code Upload Instructions:**
1. Connect the Arduino to your PC via USB cable.
2. Open Arduino IDE.
3. Copy and paste the smart dustbin code into the Arduino IDE.
4. Click on **Verify** to check for errors.
5. Click on **Upload** to upload the code to the Arduino board.

**Troubleshooting:**
- If the servo motor is not responding, check its wiring and ensure it is properly powered.
- If the ultrasonic sensor is not detecting distance, verify connections and try replacing the sensor.
- Ensure correct COM port is selected in the Arduino IDE.

**Notes:**
- Ensure the servo motor is not overloaded.
- Modify the distance threshold in the code if needed.
- Use an external power supply if the servo does not function properly due to insufficient power from the Arduino board.

**Safety Precautions:**
- Avoid short circuits while connecting wires.
- Do not force the servo motor manually to avoid damage.
- Handle electronic components carefully to prevent static damage.

This guide ensures proper setup of the smart dustbin system for smooth functionality.
